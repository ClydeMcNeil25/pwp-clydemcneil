    <h1>Milestone Two</h1>

        <h2>Content Strategy</h2>

            <p>My site will be one page, with the mobile first design concept in mind. The ultimate goal and tone of the site in its entirety, is to have a well professionally structured page that focuses on the projects and the clear design concepts in creating this site. Below the following sections will contain:</p>

            <p><strong>Hero Image:</strong> As soon as the page loads, there will be a hero image of a graphic that I will create with me in the design. Above in the top left corner, I will have my logo and over to the right will be a navigation bar to help the user navigate through the page.</p>

            <p><strong>About Me:</strong> Just below the hero image section there will be a picture of myself with a description of my professional history, goals, and my passions. The overall tone will be informal and casual. This section will be filled with the following:</p>

                <p>"Hello, I'm Clyde I've been in fascination with everything that has to do with technology and art all of my life. I am currently serving in the United States Air Force, going on now for 21 years and quickly approaching retirement. I'd consider myself having the thirst for knowledge and try to be a better version of myself than yesterday. I'm eagerly ready for my next chapter of my life entering into the tech industry. As a freelance graphic designer, I am passionate about solving my clients problems bringing their ideas to life. Lastly, as a web developer, I love bringing in all of my skill sets in creating meaningful products that bring people together."</p>

            <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> In this section, I will list my various skill sets and showcase them in a Z pattern design. In each section they will have a thumbnail and once when the user hovers and click on the thumbnail a responsive popout image will show more in depth image for each section. For the "Motion Graphics" and "Audio Production", there will be a responsive popout video for those sections giving a better example of my work. On the side of each section, I will list the tools with the respective hyperlinks to the product page and my roles in creating the products in their respective areas. In the continuation of the portfolio, I will list my soft skills, education, and certifications as seen in the layout below. Ultimately, I am showcasing my skill sets, in the hopes of promoting my passion for my art and web development along with attracting that potential client and/or my future employer.</p>

            <p><strong>Contact:</strong> After the user type in their name and email contact information, the user will be able to utilize the dropdown box that will contain; employment, graphic design,  web development, UX/UI design, video/audio production services, collaborate, and other. I will also list my professional social sites for the user to keep up to date with my next projects and/or to help build my social media presence. Overall, the intent is for the user to have various ways or preferences to stay in touch with me.</p>

    <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <p>The site will be fully responsive for desktop and mobile viewing options. The wireframes that you see below, were created using <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>. After exporting each mobile wireframe from Figma, I then used <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a> to group the mobile wireframe images together and added a drop shadow effect using Photoshops' blending tools section. Then I added text to each mobile screen sections for consistency with the overall layouts and documentation.</p>
