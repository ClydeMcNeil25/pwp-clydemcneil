                    Hello, I'm Clyde I've been in fascination with everything that has to do with technology and art all of my life. I am currently serving in the United States Air Force for 21 years and upon retirement, I'm eagerly ready for my next chapter of my life entering into the tech industry. As a freelance graphic artist, I am passionate about solving my clients problems bringing their ideas to life. Lastly, as a web developer, I love bringing in all of my skill sets in creating meaningful products that bring people together.
                </ol>
            <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> In this section, I will list my various skill sets and showcase them in a Z pattern design. In each section they will have a thumbnail and once when the user clicks on the thumbnail a responsive popout image will show more in depth each section.</p>
            <p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will help the user in contacting me depending on the dropdown box that will be in this section as well. I will also list my professional social sites for the user to get in touch with as well.
