    <h1>Milestone Two</h1>

        <h2>Content Strategy</h2>

            <p>My site will be one page, with the mobile first design concept in mind, and they will consist of the following sections:</p>

            <p><strong>Landing Page:</strong> As soon as the page load, there will be a hero image of a graphic that I will create with me in the design. Above in the left corner will be a navigation bar to help the user navigate through the page.</p>

            <p><strong>About Me:</strong> In this section there will be a picture of myself with a description of my professional history, strengths, and my future goals. The overall tone will be informal and casual. This section will be filled with the following:</p>

                <ol>
                    "Hello, I'm Clyde I've been in fascination with everything that has to do with technology and art all of my life. I am currently serving in the United States Air Force for 21 years and upon retirement, I'm eagerly ready for my next chapter of my life entering into the tech industry. As a freelance graphic designer, I am passionate about solving my clients problems bringing their ideas to life. Lastly, as a web developer, I love bringing in all of my skill sets in creating meaningful products that bring people together."
                </ol>

            <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> In this section, I will list my various skill sets and showcase them in a Z pattern design. In each section they will have a thumbnail and once when the user clicks on the thumbnail a responsive popout image will show more in depth image for each section. For the "Motion Graphics" and "Audio Production", there will be a responsive popout video for those sections. On the side of each section, I will list the tools with the respective hyperlinks to the product page and my roles in creating the products in their respective areas. In the continuation of the portfolio, I will list my soft skills, education, and certifications as seen in the layouts. Ultimately, I am showcasing my skill sets, in the hopes of promoting my passion for my art and to attract a potential client and/or employer.</p>

            <p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will help the user in contacting me depending on the dropdown box that will contain; employment, be in this section as well. I will also list my professional social sites for the user to get in touch with as well.</p>

    <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <p>The site will be fully responsive for desktop and mobile viewing options. The wireframes that you see below, were created using <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>. After exporting each mobile wireframe from Figma, I then used <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a> to group the mobile wireframe images together and added a drop shadow effect in Photoshops blending tools section.</p>
