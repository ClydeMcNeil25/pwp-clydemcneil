            <h2>Persona</h2>

                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Robert Blevins</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> 41</p>

                <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Robert is the CEO of Web Fox, operates fully remote and a full-service marketing agency that is considered a "One-Stop Shop" for brands to get their ideas created, with the "Cradle to the Grave" concept in mind. Usually, brands reach out to Web Fox for, creating webpages, apps, video production, logos, brochures, marketing strategies, and various other graphic design options and services.</p>

                <p><strong>Technology:</strong>

                    <p>Hardware: Robert is highly efficient Windows and Mac user. Robert has a custom-built PC from NZXT with an i9-11900KF CPU, RTX 3090 Ti, 64 GB of RAM, and 8 TB of SSD storage for his home office. He uses two 32" widescreen displays running at 4K resolution at 144hz refresh rate and a Wacom Cintiq Pro 32 pen display screen for drawing graphics digitally. For his portable on-the-go setup to help him have the same capabilities that he has in his home office, he uses a MacBook Pro laptop and an iPad Pro 12" with the Apple Pen 2 stylus.</p>

                    <p>Software: Robert and his employees makes good use of the Adobe Suite and Affinity Suite for all of their graphic designs and video productions. For 3D projects, he uses Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3Ds Max, Blender, and ZBrush. Web Fox uses slack for daily stand-ups and meetings with fellow employees and Zoom for outside parties when conducting conference calls.</p>

                <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Robert needs to evenly distribute his talented team evenly as he has some of his designers and developers working on more than one project at a time resulting in missing deadlines. His attitude through all of this are very positive as there are countless customers asking for Web Fox's service but, he feels unhappy because he is unable to keep up with the demand as he had to turn away or refer customers. His behaviors are that he does not like to speed through projects as he wants to give each client the appropriate amount of time in seeing projects through. Robert loves tech and keeps up with the newest hardware and latest design trends as he is a regular in the Reddit communities and tech blogs when getting his information. When it comes to work, he is very hands-on, due to the fact that some of his design teams do not have the particular members with the particular skill-sets to handle certain tasks, Robert jumps in and fills those gaps when needed. Other than that, Robert operates off of the concepts of integrity, accountability, respect, and humility.</p>

                <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Robert needs to hire someone that has experience with graphic and web design to help complete his team of designers. He needs someone that has the soft skills of; being a team player, friendly, shows empathy, and reliable. Robert does not like his employees to complain about problems and have no solutions. Even though, he has time to teach, he also would like for his employees to go and find the answers for themselves. The frustration lies in that Robert does not have enough time allotted to him to reviewing all the resumes and portfolios that future candidates are submitting.</p>

                <p><strong>Goals:</strong> With the limited amount of time that Robert has, he needs to fill this position as soon as possible. He wants to review and come up with three top prospects from the resume and portfolio submittals. From there, he wants to ensure that he is picking the best person for the position to complete his design teams. Robert wants his company Web Fox, to be one of the top tech companies in the industry with the services that they provide and with the right people and time, he hopes to make that happen.</p>

                <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a hiring authority and CEO of a tech company, I need to make sure that I am hiring the right potential candidate.</p>
