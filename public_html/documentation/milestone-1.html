            <h2>Persona</h2>

                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Robert Blevins</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> 41</p>

                <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Robert is the CEO of Web Fox, operates fully remote and a full-service marketing agency that is considered a "One-Stop Shop" for brands to get their ideas created, with the "Cradle to the Grave" concept in mind.

                        <ul>
                            Windows and Mac user. Robert has a custom-built PC from NZXT with an i9-11900KF CPU, RTX 3090 Ti, 64 GB of RAM, and 8 TB of SSD storage. He uses two 32" widescreen displays running at 4K resolution. For his portable on-the-go setup, he uses a MacBook Pro laptop.
                        </ul>

                    <ol>Software:</ol>

                        <ul>
                            Robert and his employees makes good use of the Adobe Suite and Affinity Suite for all of their graphic designs and video productions. For 3D projects, he uses Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3Ds Max, Blender, and ZBrush. Web Fox uses slack for daily stand-ups and meetings.
                        </ul>

                <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Robert needs to evenly distribute his talented team evenly as he has some of his designers and developers working on more than one project at a time resulting in missing deadlines. His attitude through all of this are very positive as there are countless customers asking for Web Fox's service but, he feels unhappy because he is unable to keep up with the demand as he had to turn away or refer customers. His behaviors are that he does not like to speed through projects as he wants to give each client the appropriate amount of time in seeing projects through. Robert loves tech and keeps up with the newest hardware and latest design trends as he is a regular in the Reddit communities getting his information. When it comes to work, he is very hands-on, due to the fact that some of his design teams do not have the particular member with the particular skill-sets to handle certain tasks. Other than that, Robert operates off of the concepts of integrity, accountability, respect, and humility.</p>

                <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Robert needs to hire someone that has experience with graphic and web design to help complete his team of designers. He needs someone that have the soft skills of; being a team player, friendly, shows empathy, and reliable. Robert does not like his employers to complain about a problem and have no solution. Even though, he has time to teach, he also would like for his employees to go and find the answers for themselves. The frustration lies in that Robert does not have enough time allotted to him to reviewing all the resumes and portfolios that future candidates are submitting.</p>

                <p><strong>Goals:</strong> With the limited amount of time that Robert has, he needs to fill this position as soon as possible. He wants to review and come up with three top prospects from the resume and portfolio submittals, and he wants to ensure that he is picking the best person for the position on one of his design teams. Robert wants his company Web Fox, to be one of the top tech companies in the industry with the services that they provide.</p>

                <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a hiring authority of a tech company, I need to make sure that I am hiring a potential candidate.</p>
